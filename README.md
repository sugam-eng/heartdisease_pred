# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using the Framingham Heart Study dataset and logistic regression.

## 💡 Overview
- Used logistic regression to build a binary classification model.
- Applied preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Framingham Heart Study dataset
- **Target Variable**: `TenYearCHD` (1 = risk of heart disease in 10 years, 0 = no risk)

## 🧪 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
